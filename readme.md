# About

This repository contains **ethical cybersecurity training material** for students, focused on WordPress pentesting in a sandbox environment. The program is organized by [Kibervarnost](https://kibervarnost.si) to teach safe, hands-on practices for understanding and mitigating common web vulnerabilities.

In addition, we offer **website migration services** to help businesses move away from WordPress, making their sites secure and rock solid, reducing the risk of attacks and simplifying long-term maintenance.
